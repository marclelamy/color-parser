# Color Parser ðŸŽ¨

A powerful color parsing tool that helps you instantly convert, and manage colors. Load the app, and it will automatically detect and display them in an intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Multi-format Parsing**: Automatically detects and parses a wide range of color formats, including hex, RGB(A), HSL(A), and more.
- **Interactive Color Panels**: Each detected color is displayed in its own interactive panel, showing detailed information and visual representations.
- **Dynamic Editing**: Edit color values on the fly and see the changes instantly.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically pastes and parses content from your clipboard on page load.
- **Exporting**: Convert and export colors to your desired format (e.g., RGBA, Hex).


## Roadmap 
- add support for more formats 
- make mobile responsive (display as flex col rather than row the color panels)
- round-trip color conversion
- add a button for "my string didn't work" with string issue + message or the user - rate limit the form 
- the export needs more output types and maybe ways wher users can write their own custom string with params as `{func_name}({r}-{g}-{b}, {a}) for ex
- add option to change layout to grid of color and on hover block scales 2x with drop shadow and shows more details than on the unscaled
- add more content to the panels like color suggestion and more
