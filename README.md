# Color Parser

A powerful color parsing tool that helps you instantly analyze, convert, and manage colors from any text source. Paste any text containing color codes, and the app will automatically detect and display them in an intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Multi-format Parsing**: Automatically detects and parses a wide range of color formats, including hex, RGB(A), HSL(A), and color names.
- **Interactive Color Panels**: Each detected color is displayed in its own interactive panel, showing detailed information and visual representations.
- **Dynamic Editing**: Edit color values on the fly and see the changes instantly.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically pastes and parses content from your clipboard on page load.
- **Exporting**: Convert and export colors to your desired format (e.g., RGBA, Hex).

## Usage

Simply paste any block of text (like CSS, Tailwind config, or just a list of colors) into the application. The tool will parse it and display all found colors. You can then inspect, modify, and export them.

## Roadmap 
- Support for oklch which doesn't work in the input
- make mobile responsive (display as flex col rather than row the color panels)
